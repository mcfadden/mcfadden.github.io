I love to write software that solves real needs.

I'm currently working at [Forge Apps](http://forgeapps.com) as a Senior Developer. I've been here since 2012.

I've worked on [some](http://theworshipinitiative.com) [pretty](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/john-piper-daily-devotional/id553049864?mt=8) [cool](http://lightstock.com) [projects](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ask-pastor-john/id606284215?mt=8) while I've been here.

In 2013 I co-founded [Sermons.io](https://sermons.io/?utm_source=benmcfaddenio&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=product_link). I think it's amazing. If you're a church you should definitely check it out.

I primarily work on Ruby and iOS apps.

I write a lot of apps that solve my own needs and automate tasks around my house.

I'm in Chandler, Arizona and have worked remotely with clients across the country.
