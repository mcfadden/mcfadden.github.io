I love to write software that solves real needs.

I've been working at [Planning Center](https://planning.center) since the summer of 2016.

In 2013 I co-founded [Sermons.io](https://sermons.io/?utm_source=benmcfaddenio&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=product_link), a boutique Sermon library management tool. I think it's pretty cool. If you're a church you should definitely check it out.

I primarily work with Ruby on Rails, but I've been known to make some custom iOS apps as well. I write a lot of apps and utilities that solve my own needs and automate tasks around my house.
